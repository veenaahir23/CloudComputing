# CloudComputing

These are part of my Cloud Computing course.
I developed 6 mini applications using Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS to be deployed to IBMBluemix, Azure and AWS.
Database used: MySql.
JMeter used to scale application.
SQL workbench used for AWS.
Code examples for the same have been uploaded. 

The hosting are not available as of now, since they were free trails purchased during the duration of course.
